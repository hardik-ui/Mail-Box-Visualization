# Mail-Box-Visualization
Analyzing an EMAIL Archive from gmane and vizualizing the data using the D3 JavaScript library. The first step is to spider the gmane repository.  The base URL 
is hard-coded in the gmane.py and is hard-coded to the Sakai
developer list.  You can spider another repository by changing that
base url.
